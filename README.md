# Time Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Time Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/time-calculator

## Solution

This is my solution to free code camps second project for the course, "Scientific computing with Python". I've left the main heading and content the same as free code camp has given it.

## Running

To run my code, clone this repository to your local machine, and open a terminal in that directory. You can then install the dependencies with,

```cmd
pip install pytest
```

You can then run tests with `pytest`.
